## Project Overview
My web application is a NFL Trivia Quiz that is focused on testing the users' knowledge of random 2022 NFL trivia. The Trivia is based on positions and who led in a stat that year. I tried to make the quiz as user friendly as possible while still being engaging with a few interactive features. 

## Usage Guidelines
To interact with the application, users can follow these steps:
1. Click on the "**To The Quiz**" button on the homepage to start the quiz.
2. Answer the trivia questions presented, and click "**Next Question**" to proceed.
3. Receive immediate feedback on correct and incorrect answers.
4. Upon completion, view the quiz result, showing the percentage score and details.

## Dependencies
The project depends on the folllowing: 
- **Bootstrap** (v4.0.0)
- **jQuery** (v3.2.1)
- **Popper.js** (v1.12.9)
- **Canvas Confetti library** (v1.0.3)
- **nfl.import_team_desc()**
- **nfl.import_seasonal_data([2022])**
- **nfl.import_schedules([2022])**
